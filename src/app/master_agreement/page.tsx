            Customer's use of the Services, including data privacy,
            international communications, personal data transmission and export
            control regulations. Customer shall: (i) promptly notify Agilemove
            of any unauthorized account usage or suspected security breaches
            related to the Services; (ii) immediately report to Agilemove and
            use reasonable efforts to halt any copying, distribution or misuse
            of Content, Agilemove Technology, Services or Deliverables that
            comes to Customer's attention; and (iii) refrain from impersonating
            other CoWrkr users or providing false credentials to access the
            Services. When Customer accesses Services using third-party
            credentials (such as Google or Microsoft), Customer must comply with
            all applicable terms and conditions of such third parties regarding
            credential provisioning and usage. Customer remains accountable for
            all actions performed using Customer's accounts and credentials.
            Customer is solely responsible for maintaining compliance with
            relevant third-party platform terms and conditions and keeping
            appropriate accounts in good standing with third-party platform
            providers.

            refuse, or remove Content that (1) violates applicable laws or
            regulations, (2) breaches these Terms, and/or (3) creates liability
            for Agilemove. Customer acknowledges that Authorized Users may
            search, view, use, modify, and reproduce Customer Content submitted
            to Service areas. Customer will maintain documented privacy policies
            governing data collection through the Services and agrees to comply
            with such policies.

            termination or expiration, Agilemove will return Customer Data
            within 60 days in a mutually acceptable format, after which Customer
            Data will be permanently deleted within 90 days of data delivery;
            absent such request within 30 days of Agreement termination or
            expiration, Agilemove will delete all Customer Data from Services
            within 90 days of Agreement termination or expiration. Agilemove
            will not disclose Customer Data except for (a) actions by Agilemove
            personnel to deliver Services and address service or technical
            issues, (b) as required by law, or (c) as authorized by Customer.

            monthly), excluding scheduled maintenance periods and

            9. Payment Terms and Billing
          </h2>
          <p>
            Customer shall remit all fees specified in each executed Statement
            of Work ("Fees"). Payment obligations are non-cancelable and amounts
            paid are non-refundable unless expressly specified otherwise in the
            applicable Statement of Work. Unless the applicable Statement of
            Work provides otherwise, payment terms are net thirty (30) days from
            Agilemove invoice receipt, without setoffs or deductions, payable in
            US dollars. For credit card or electronic money transfer (ACH)
            payments specified in Statements of Work, charges are processed upon
            invoice date. Agilemove Fees exclude all taxes, levies, or duties
            imposed by taxing authorities, with Customer responsible for such
            payments, excluding taxes based solely on Agilemove's income. If
            Agilemove must legally pay or collect taxes for which Customer is
            responsible, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to Customer
            unless Customer provides a valid tax exemption certificate from the
            appropriate taxing authority. Customer must contact Agilemove in
            writing within sixty (60) days of invoice date for any billing
            disputes to be eligible for adjustments or credits.

          <p>
            Agilemove may modify Service Fees and introduce new charges
            effective upon the next Renewal Service Term by providing Customer
            written notice at least forty-five (45) days before the current
            Service Term ends. If Customer does not provide termination notice
            to Agilemove as described in Section 10, Fee changes become
            effective at the next Renewal Service Term commencement. Should
            Customer fail to make payments according to Agreement or Statement
            of Work terms, requiring legal enforcement by Agilemove, Customer
            agrees to pay all reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by
            Agilemove.

            This Agreement's Initial Term begins on the Statement of Work
            Effective Date of the first Statement of Work and continues until
            all underlying Statements of Work expire according to their terms,
            or earlier Agreement termination as provided herein. Each Statement
            of Work term begins on its Effective Date and continues for the
            initial period specified therein ("Initial Service Term").
            Statements of Work containing Services added to existing
            subscriptions will be billed pro-rata and terminate concurrently
            with the Initial Service Term or applicable Renewal Service Term.
            Unless a Statement of Work specifies otherwise, or this Agreement
            terminates as described in Section 12, upon Initial Service Term
            expiration, Statements of Work automatically renew for subsequent
            twelve (12) month Renewal Service Terms (subject to Fee adjustments
            per Section 9), unless either party provides termination notice at
            least thirty (30) days before the current Service Term ends.

            Beyond other rights granted herein, Agilemove may suspend or
            terminate this Agreement, related Statements of Work, and Customer's
            Service access if Customer's account becomes delinquent and remains
            uncured for thirty (30) days. Delinquent invoices accrue interest at
            1.5% monthly on outstanding balances, or the maximum legally
            permitted rate, whichever is lower, from due date, plus all
            collection expenses. Agilemove may remove credit terms from
            Statements of Work when Customer accounts become delinquent (e.g.,
            reducing net 30 payment terms to net 0). Customer continues
            incurring Fees during Service suspension periods due to Customer
            delinquency. If Agilemove terminates this Agreement for cause per
            Section 12, Customer owes all remaining Fees calculated according to
            their terms for the remainder of the applicable Initial Service Term
            or Renewal Service Term. Customer agrees Agilemove may charge unpaid
            Fees to Customer's credit card or via ACH payment, or otherwise bill
            Customer for such unpaid Fees.

            15. Mutual Indemnification
          </h2>
          <p>
            Agilemove will indemnify and hold harmless Customer and its
            subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys
            and agents from claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and
            expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from claims alleging
            that Service usage infringes or misappropriates valid third-party
            intellectual property rights. For Agilemove to defend Customer,
            Customer must: (a) promptly provide written claim notice to
            Agilemove; (b) grant Agilemove sole control over claim defense and
            settlement, provided Customer may participate in its defense at its
            expense; (c) provide Agilemove with claim information and cooperate
            during defense or settlement efforts; and (d) take reasonable steps
            to mitigate losses subject to the claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agilemove has no liability or indemnification obligation if
            infringement, misappropriation, or violation results from (1)
            Service usage combined with non-Agilemove software or products; (2)
            process infringement claims; (3) compliance with ITU, IEEE or other
            recognized industry standards; or (4) Agilemove modifications to
            conform to Customer specifications. When Agilemove has
            indemnification obligations, it may, at its discretion and at no
            Customer cost: (i) modify Services to eliminate infringement or
            misappropriation, (ii) obtain licenses for Customer's continued
            Service usage per this Agreement, or (iii) if (i) or (ii) are not
            commercially feasible, terminate Customer subscriptions for such
            Services and refund prepaid fees covering the remaining subscription
            term after termination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer will indemnify and hold harmless Agilemove, its
            subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys
            and agents from claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and
            expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from: (1) claims
            alleging that Customer Data transmission, storage, or usage
            infringes third-party rights or causes third-party harm; or (2)
            claims based on facts that, if true, would constitute Customer
            violations of Agreement covenants, representations, or warranties.
            Customer's defense and indemnification obligations regarding
            particular claims require: (a) Agilemove providing prompt written
            claim notice to Customer; (b) Agilemove granting Customer sole
            control over claim defense and settlement, provided Agilemove may
            participate in its defense at its expense; (c) Agilemove providing
            Customer with claim information and cooperating during defense or
            settlement efforts; and (d) Agilemove taking reasonable steps to
            mitigate losses subject to the claim.

            20. Confidential Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            Parties receiving confidential information agree to implement
            reasonable protective measures, at least equivalent to measures used
            to protect their own proprietary information but not less than
            reasonable care, to prevent unauthorized duplication or disclosure
            to third parties without prior written consent from the disclosing
            party. Each party shall use the other party's Confidential
            Information solely for Service performance purposes during the term
            and thereafter. Confidentiality obligations regarding Confidential
            Information remain effective during the Agreement Term and for three
            (3) years following Agreement termination or expiration.

            "Confidential Information" encompasses all information, regardless
            of form or identification, whether of the disclosing party or its
            clients or affiliates, furnished or made available through Agreement
            licensing that is not generally known outside the disclosing party,
            its clients, employees or Affiliates, or which the receiving party
            knows or should reasonably know is confidential or proprietary given
            the information's nature and disclosure circumstances. Confidential
            Information includes (a) Customer Data, (b) pricing terms offered to
            Customer in Statements of Work, and (c) Agilemove Technology.
            Neither party will disclose Agreement pricing or other terms to
            anyone except attorneys, accountants, and professional advisors
            under confidentiality duties, except (a) as legally required, or (b)
            pursuant to mutually agreeable press releases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confidential Information excludes information that: (i) becomes
            generally known through publication, commercial use or otherwise
            without receiving party fault; (ii) was known and documented by the
            receiving party at disclosure time without restrictions; (iii) was
            independently developed by the receiving party or learned from third
            parties without Confidential Information access; (iv) was lawfully
            obtained from third parties with disclosure rights; or (v) was made
            generally available by the disclosing party without disclosure
            restrictions. The receiving party may disclose Confidential
            Information pursuant to judicial or governmental orders, provided
            the receiving party either (i) provides reasonable advance notice to
            allow the disclosing party to seek protective orders when legally
            permitted, or (ii) obtains written assurance from judicial or
            governmental entities that they will afford Confidential Information
            the highest protection available under applicable law or regulation.

          <p>
            This Agreement is governed by Florida law and controlling United

            provisions, for all disputes, actions, claims or causes of action
            arising from this Agreement or Services. No text or information on
            purchase orders, preprinted forms or documents (other than
            Statements of Work) shall modify this Agreement's terms and
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any Agreement provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a
            competent court, such provision(s) shall be construed as closely as
            possible to reflect the invalid or unenforceable provision's
            intentions, with all other provisions remaining fully effective. No
            joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship
            exists between Customer and Agilemove due to this Agreement or
            Service usage. Either party's failure to enforce Agreement rights or
            provisions does not constitute waiver unless acknowledged and agreed
            in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Agreement, together with applicable Statements of Work
            (including referenced documents), comprises the complete agreement
            between Customer and Agilemove regarding the subject matter and
            supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or
            agreements, whether written or oral, between parties regarding such
            subject matter. In conflicts between Agreement and Statement of Work
            terms, Statement of Work terms govern solely to the conflict extent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should one or more Agreement provisions be invalid or unenforceable,
            courts will modify and interpret provisions to best accomplish
            original provision objectives to the fullest legally permitted
            extent, with remaining provision enforceability unimpaired.
